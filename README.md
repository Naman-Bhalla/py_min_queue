# py_min_stack

Python implementation of a Queue that supports find_min() alongwith usual queue operations.

The time and space complexities of find_min() are as follows:

  - O(1) Time
  - O(1) Space (For Integers), O(n) Space (Generalized) [n = size of stack]

Enqueue, Deque are O(1) time as usual.

# Motivation

Came across a problem while solving a Competitive Programming question and came to know about this 
particular data structure.
